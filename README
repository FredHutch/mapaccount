INSTALLATION:

make all

creates the virtualenv, installs necessary modules.

make install-config

puts a template (filling in a random value for the CSRF key) into the necessary location.  You will need to fill in the LDAP bind information.

service

copy hutchnet.conf to /etc/init and tell upstart:
    initctl reload-configuration

then you can use service to control the "hutchnet" service

NOTES:

(14 April 2014) the version of flask in pip doesn't have the JSON interpreter
for configuration files. Thus, we're calling out to flask source on github to
get the most current.
